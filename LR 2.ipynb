    "1. Easy interpretation: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are intuitive metrics that provide a straightforward understanding of the average prediction error or deviation. They are expressed in the same units as the dependent variable, making them easily interpretable.\n",

    "2. Sensitivity to outliers: RMSE and MSE give higher weight to larger errors due to the squared term, which can be useful in situations where outliers or extreme values need to be penalized more heavily. MAE, on the other hand, treats all errors equally regardless of their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Widely used and standard: RMSE, MSE, and MAE are widely accepted and commonly used metrics in regression analysis. They have become standard evaluation measures, allowing for easy comparison and benchmarking across studies or models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages and considerations when using these metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lack of context: While RMSE, MSE, and MAE provide measures of prediction error, they do not provide contextual information about the impact or significance of the errors. They do not capture the directionality or practical implications of the errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scale dependence: RMSE and MSE are sensitive to the scale of the dependent variable. This means that models with larger or smaller scale dependent variables may yield larger or smaller errors, respectively, even if the predictive performance is similar. MAE is not affected by the scale of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Preference for different metrics: The choice of evaluation metric may vary depending on the specific context and priorities of the analysis. For example, RMSE and MSE are commonly used when larger errors are considered more critical, while MAE may be preferred when equal weighting of errors is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Potential for outliers: RMSE and MSE can be more influenced by outliers due to the squared term, which might be undesirable in certain situations. MAE, being less sensitive to outliers, may be more appropriate when robustness against extreme values is desired.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to consider these advantages and disadvantages and choose the evaluation metric that aligns with the specific requirements and goals of the regression analysis. Additionally, it can be valuable to use multiple evaluation metrics together to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance."

Interpreting the effects of individual predictors becomes less straightforward when coefficients are penalized or set to zero.\n",

Determining the optimal value of these hyperparameters can be challenging and may require cross-validation or other optimization methods.\n",
